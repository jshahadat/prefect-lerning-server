We all know that today technology has achieved milestones in every field you can think of, right now and this is the very reason why engineering must also keep updated with the growing technology. This has led to several changes in how engineers work and perform. Not just the use of technology has made lives way easier but has also because of the development of some cool software, encouraged engineers to deliver more One such software that is going to be talked about in this blog is the ETABS Software. Have a look at the following sections that explain to you what is ETABS Software, why should it be used, what are the advantages of using it, and a brief description of its significance."
